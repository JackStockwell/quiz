# JavaScript Quiz

The reason for making this quiz is I wanted to create a website to test my knowledge on JavaScript both practically and literally. 

I have used the various techniques from basic for loops to querySelctors and eventlisteners to create the quiz.

The quiz involves dynamically creating as well as showing and hiding elements with the HTML page to load new questions and answers, avoids cluttering the page with a section for each question.

One of my main challenges was getting it all to come together, I faced issues with the generation of new questions which led to me splitting it across two functions; another was how to store the data in localstorage, whether that was with objects with an array of names and scores or just an array.

I gained a deeper understand of JavaScript during this entire project as well as allowing me to flex a bit more of CSS capabilties.
